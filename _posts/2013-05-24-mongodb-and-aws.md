I came across [this talk](http://www.10gen.com/presentations/high-performance-high-scale-mongodb-aws-hands-guide) on using MongoDB with Amazon Web Services. It is focused around how you can achieve simplicity, stability and scalability through using the two together. For anyone interested in getting a feel for how you go about using MongoDB on AWS and why they are a good fit it is well worth a look. 

AWS also has a great [Whitepaper](http://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/mongodb-on-aws) which covers best practice. It takes you through installing MongoDB, setting up replica sets and sharding, backups, monitoring, security etc.
