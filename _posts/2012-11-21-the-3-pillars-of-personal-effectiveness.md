While having a look around <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> recently I came across the book <a href="http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/three-pillars">3 Pillars of Personal Effectiveness</a> by Troels Richter. As someone full of enthusism with lots of things I want to look at but limited time I'm constantly striving for ways to become more effective in the time I do have. One thing that really caught my eye in the book was the idea of a personal kanban board. It seems like a great way to capture the things I want to do/achieve and make sure I complete them so I'm going to give it a go.

I'm hoping that setting a limit on things that I have in progress will help me to focus on the task in hand and see it through to completion stopping me having lots of tasks in progress but no end result. I've found a tool called <a href="https://kanbanflow.com/">KanbanFlow</a>. I won't go into the details of it apart from to say it is free, there is a quick tutorial to get you started and it seems really easy to use. Whether I record it this way long term is not really the point. It is more about training myself to prioritise what I want to do, focusing on the current tasks before taking on more and seeing tasks through to some end value.
