If, like me, you've no local JUG you'll be pleased to hear about the creation of vJUG a Virtual Java User Group where you can watch presentations and interact in real time with those presenting and attending. You can join online via their [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/). The first event took place last week with [Trisha Gee](http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/) explaining why "Design is a Process, Not a Document" and was a real success. A number of future events are already planned with "Drive by Contributions" A GitHub session by Brent Beer and Matthew McCullough taking place tomorrow. Check it out!
