Over the past week I've started listening to the [Developer Tea](https://developertea.com) podcast. None of the episodes are long with each one averaging less than 20 mins. A lot of the podcasts I enjoy are an hour or more in length so it is a nice addition to have one which is shorter for when I want a quick burst of inspiration. Episodes are recorded regularly for example in the past week alone there have been three episodes, *Learning on the Job*, *Comparison Conundrums* and *Feature's You Don't Need*. Each episode is well structured, often providing actionable advice to help you make positive changes. Definitely worth checking out.
