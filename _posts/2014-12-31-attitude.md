With just hours left before 2015 a final post driven by the events of the past week. Over the Christmas hols I've experienced going from the best feeling in the world to one of the saddest points in my life and it got me thinking about the power of having the right attitude. 

Sometimes in life things happen, horrible things and often whether they happen or not is something you have no control over. This was the case in the past few days. There was nothing I could have done to prevent what happened taking place. What I did have control over is how I reacted. The old me would have spent weeks feeling down, wondering why her and generally getting sucked down by it. A victim.

I refuse to be that person and so while I have shed a tear or two and wondered briefly why me, I'm now dusting myself off and looking forward to new opportunities in 2015. Reflecting on the event, learning lessons and making changes. Trying to get something positive out of it. It is not the end just a set back.

I've learnt over the past year or two the benefit of taking a positive attitude, embracing failure and criticism, seeing it as an opportunity to grow and a motivation to change, prove it wrong and succeed.
