I recently finished a project and it made me think about the difference taking time to communicate can make to a person. We are always talking about the importance of not calling people resources. The need to make them feel valued. All to often it is easy to get caught up in dramatic gestures  and forget about the impact of day to day interactions.

When I was finishing up on a large project earlier this year, two senior members of the team took time to talk to me 1 to 1. They explained when the project was finishing up and the opportunities beyond this. They were both busy and had a lot of people to look after along with customers to keep happy. That 10-15 mins made me feel more valued than any fancy employee benefits scheme could do. It said I appreciate what you've done. I care enough about you and your career to make sure you know the opportunities that lie ahead.
