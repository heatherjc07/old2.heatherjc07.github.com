> Don't think of your website as a self-promotion machine, instead think of it as a self-invention machine. Fill your website with your work and your ideas and the stuff you care about. Austin Kleon, Show Your Work!

I'm currently in the process of reading [Show Your Work!](http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) (which is great) and I really loved this quote. I started this site up a couple of years ago when returning to work after having Luke mainly as a means of making myself accountable to keep learning and sharing what I learned. On reading the quote it made me re-evaluate what I was posting so you'll probably notice me posting some stuff that is less specific to IT but I feel helps me be a happier more productive programmer. I'll also be posting some shorter posts on things which have inspired or struck a cord with me. I guess on the whole I want the site to have a bit more personality and represent better who I am.
