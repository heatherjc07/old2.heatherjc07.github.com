At the start of January I got the chance to present at the Belfast branch of [Women Who Code](http://womenwhocode.co.uk/).It was my first go at running a workshop style session where the audience had a go at coding and I did some live typing. Definitely harder to pull off than an all talking presentation but a great experience. There was a good turn out and it was great to meet other women working in firms around Belfast and studying IT at uni. 

I've stuck the code up on [github](https://github.com/heatherjc07/RubyIntroduction) and the slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/heathercampbell9822/intro-to-ruby-29818809) so hopefully other people beyond the audience that night will find them useful.

BTW if your company needs a push to see the value of you presenting take a look at this brilliant [post](http://zachholman.com/posts/github-speaking-culture/) by Zach Holman
