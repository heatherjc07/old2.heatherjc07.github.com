I've signed up for <a href="http://www.10gen.com/">10gen's</a> online training courses. Two of the courses started this week. One from a developer perspective, learning about creating a blog with MongoDB using python, and the other from a DBA perspective. There is also one near the end of February using Java and MongoDB which I plan to take a look at. I'll let you know how they go and whether I'd recommend them. I find it really useful at times having deadlines whether imposed by others like these courses or by myself, e.g. by committing to a talk about a subject. With so many things vying for my time it can be easy to make excuses for not getting round to looking at things. Deadlines give me the kick up the backside I need to get things done.

More information can be found <a href="http://www.10gen.com/press/10gen-announces-new-course-dates-its-popular-online-developer-and-dba-training">here</a>. I've only had a quick look at the course material but the webcasts seem to be a nice length to fit in when you get a moment. Nothing too long.
