Having already completed all six seasons of Private Practice, a couple of seasons of Girls and started rewatching Greys Anatomy I thought maybe it was time to find something outside of boxsets to entertain me while feeding my 6 week old son. As highlighted in this article about [reading 100 books in a year](http://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/how-even-the-busiest-entrepreneur-can-read-100-books-a-year.html) feeding my baby gives me lots of opportunity to sit and read so I'm finally tackling my backlog of books. Being trapped under him while he sleeps also works well.

I'm good at adding items to my wishlist and purchasing them but recently I've been poor at reading them through to completion. I found out about the goodreads reading challenge tracker on twitter and decided to give it a whirl. It'll help me keep momentum. I've set an achievable target of 12 books, one for each month (100 was a bit ambitious for me!).

Over the past week I've discovered ebooks work best. I've mastered the art of feeding Marc while reading my ebook and taking notes on my phone using Evernote. In fact I've even taken it to the next level, feeding, expressing and reading at once. Multitasking to the max.

Before  having Marc I preferred paper books for reading but trying to hold a paper book and feed is just too much of a fiddle. Being able to flick between reading and taking notes on the same device is so much simpler. I've completed my January book, The Phoenix Project, and moved onto Lean UX so going well so far.
