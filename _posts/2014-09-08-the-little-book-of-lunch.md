Recently I thought it would be good to start sharing things that help me to be a happy, healthy programmer. This post falls under that category and is a review of [The Little Book of Lunch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Book-Lunch-Caroline-Craig/dp/0224095730/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1410190693&sr=1-1&keywords=the+little+book+of+lunch).

I tend to mostly take a packed lunch to work and had got stuck in a real sandwich and soup rut. I'm pretty flat out at the moment and lunchtime is my little sanctuary of calm and it just felt like I wasn't making the most of it. I wanted to change up my lunch and start making it something I really looked forward to. Something that would lift my spirits and leave be feeling revitalised after a hard morning. 

Wandering through a bookshop one lunchtime I came across [The Little Book of Lunch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Book-Lunch-Caroline-Craig/dp/0224095730/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1410190693&sr=1-1&keywords=the+little+book+of+lunch). Flicking through the pages I was impressed by how many of the recipes appealed to me. In general the recipes require a small number of ingredients. I don't want to have to buy in a million things for one lunch. They also tend to have a short preparation time. Having a fulltime job, house, toddler and dog to look after means spare time is at a premium. The book even simplifies your weekly shop by grouping recipes with similar ingredients and providing a shopping list. Genius.

I've had the book a couple of months now and I've not been disappointed in a recipe yet. I've tried lots of different things including:

- Herby Quinoa With Peas & Seasonal Greens
- Spanish Lunch: Chorizo Egg & Potato Salad
- Rainbow Rescue
- Vietnamese Salad
- South-East Asian Pho
- Thai Fishcakes
- Harissa Chicken
- Simple Tortilla
- Salted Caramel Brownies (I don't want to count how many of the batch I ate myself. Scared to make the peanut butter ones as I'd prob eat the lot)
- Lemon Curd Cupcakes

I've enjoyed them all and they've transported well too. I feel like I'm fuelling my body with something healthy and not processed and they feel like a treat. 

To help with transporting I got myself some really cute Tupperware from Paperchase a bit like [these](http://www.paperchase.co.uk/gifts/home-and-kitchen-gifts/lunch-boxes-bottles/all-change-snack-boxes-set-of-4.html). (If my 20 year old self could see me now she'd be so disappointed at me getting excited about this). The smallest one is great for dressings. Also got myself a wee flask from ikea.

I've found I'm using herbs so much more that I'm now growing mint, coriander and basil. Sainsburys sell them at a pound a pop so very small outlay and so far they've survived and I'm by no means the most green fingered of people. Breaking off a mint stalk, sticking it in a cup and adding boiled water makes the best mint tea. Much better than a teabag.

If you're looking to spruce up your lunchtimes look no further than [The Little Book of Lunch](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Little-Book-Lunch-Caroline-Craig/dp/0224095730/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1410190693&sr=1-1&keywords=the+little+book+of+lunch). Well worth a purchase.
