With so much interesting stuff happening in technology it can be hard to know where to start when trying to keep up to date. It can overwhelm you to the point where you don't start. If you're looking for some sound advice check out [Trisha Gee](https://twitter.com/trisha_gee)'s post on [Staying ahead of the curve](http://trishagee.github.io/post/staying_ahead_of_the_curve/). 

Two things I liked in particular:

* She emphasizes the importance of deciding to not learn something. Take time to rule out things.
* Just because you decide to not learn something now doesn't mean you can never pick it up.
