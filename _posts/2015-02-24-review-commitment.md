Over the past day I've been reading [Commitment](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Commitment-Novel-about-Managing-Project/dp/9082056909) by Olav Maassen, Chris Matts and Chris Geary. 

Commitment is a graphic novel which makes it easily devoured and once I started I couldn't put it down until it was read. After a long day at work an easy read is welcome!

Some of the takeaways from commitment:

* Don't treat options as commitments
* If you're unsure of the correct approach you have 3 choices. Postpone the decision and collect more info. Choose the option easiest to change. Invest in an approach which allows change to be easier.
* Value clearing technical debt
* Value making your work and its flow through the stages visual
* Multitasking creates hidden queues. See one thing through to completion
* Focus on end result. Prioritise what brings value and then identify steps to deliver
* Value staff liquidity. No keyman. Allocate people with least options first and most options last. Don't need 100% liquidity, more like 10%
* Opposite of a good relationship is no relationship
