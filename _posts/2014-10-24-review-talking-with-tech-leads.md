A couple of weeks ago I was having a browse around the books on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com) and I came across [Talking with Tech Leads](https://leanpub.com/talking-with-tech-leads) by Patrick Kua. The book contains 35 interviews with Tech Leads from first timers to experienced pros seeing how they balance the technical and non technical demands. Exploring how the reality of being a tech lead differed from their expectations and the skills they've had to develop along the way. It is an easy read and I would recommend it to senior developers looking to make the transition as it is an insight into what a day being a tech lead involves.  

Over my next couple of posts I'm going to explore some of the topics in the book which struct a cord with me:

* Redefining Your Value
* Building Up Others
* Welcoming Input
* Seeing the Bigger Picture
* Staying in Touch with the Code
* Developing Yourself
* Valuing Building Relationships
* Establishing Team Culture
* Managing Your Time
* Disagreement is Not Criticism
