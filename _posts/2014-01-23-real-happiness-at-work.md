When I was pregnant and during Luke's birth I found visualization and breathing techniques really useful. They helped me to focus and stay relaxed. I highly recommend [Pregnancy Health Yoga](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pregnancy-Health-Yoga-Tara-Lee/dp/B0012KSDG0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390517019&sr=8-1&keywords=pregnancy+yoga) which is a DVD aimed at pregnant women. 

Recently at work I've been on a really busy project and while I'm loving my role and the buzz when you combine it with a 2 year with boundless energy and a house to keep I have found myself at times over tired and a bit strung out. When I was reading through tweets on the train the other day I came across one about a book [Real Happiness at Work](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-Happiness-Work-Meditations-Accomplishment/dp/0761168990/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390517404&sr=8-1&keywords=real+happiness+at+work) which caught my eye. It's all about using meditation at work and after my success during pregnancy I thought I'd give it a go. I'll post a post when I get stuck in and let you know if it helped.
